# Ribbon Drift

Ribbon Drift treats composition as evidence of movement rather than placement. The image is not arranged; it is negotiated by trajectories that bend, split, hesitate, and then commit. Each shape is a temporal residue of directional intent, where a path becomes a body and every body remembers the field that generated it. The result should feel inevitable yet surprising, a balance reached through a meticulously crafted algorithm rather than decorative accident.

The system is built on a low-frequency vector field that provides long directional coherence, then punctured with local turbulence that introduces subtle disagreement between nearby trajectories. Those disagreements are where character appears: ribbons widen, narrow, or pivot into neighboring lanes. The implementation should read as the product of deep computational expertise, with painstaking optimization of field smoothness, turn thresholds, and spacing rules so disorder never collapses into noise.

Color is not applied as paint but assigned as structural rhythm. Palettes move in restrained families, and sequence weighting creates visual cadence across the canvas so that dense passages and open passages speak in the same voice. Contrast is used surgically: enough to define hierarchy, never enough to fracture unity. This chromatic behavior must feel master-level in its restraint, as though tuned across countless iterations until every hue transition supports flow.

Segmentation is the key expressive mechanism. Instead of uninterrupted strokes, each ribbon is broken into linked slabs whose corners are softly rounded and whose widths breathe over distance. This converts line into architecture and gives each trajectory a printed, cut-paper tactility. The geometry should reflect a master-level implementation where segment length, width jitter, and corner handling are calibrated with precision so forms feel handcrafted even when generated.

Variation is driven by seeds, but seeds are treated as alternate universes under identical laws. The same seed must always produce the same composition, and neighboring seeds should reveal meaningful stylistic drift rather than total reset. The final work should present itself as a living system refined through patient, meticulous craftsmanship: controlled chaos shaped by expert constraint, where beauty emerges from process with uncompromising technical discipline.
